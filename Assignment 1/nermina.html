        <h2>Year: Senior Major: IT</h2>
        <p1>Hello! I am Nermina Jasarevic and I am in my fourth year at Mizzou.
            I am originally from St. Louis, MO and I am the president of the Mizzou League of Legends Club.
            I chose IT as my major because there is a lot of different things you can do with the degree and it's fun to be able to learn new things throughout the entirety of your career.
