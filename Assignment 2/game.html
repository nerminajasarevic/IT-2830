        <p> I like League of Legends because I enjoy the competitive aspects of the game. 
            I most often play with my teammates I met on campus and we practice under a division where we face off against other university teams. 
            There is so many different ways to play and synergize with your team and its a game that's easy to learn but difficult to master which is why it's my favorite game!
